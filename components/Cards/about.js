          Our goal as a professional breeder is simple. Itâ€™s to deliver American
          Dobermans of the highest standard of quality to new owners. In order
          to make such a commitment, we are focused on a simple promise--that
          all of our pups will be properly raised with love and compassion.
          <br />
          The responsibility that comes with bringing these fragile young lives
          into the world is a lifelong commitment from us at Odremans. As we
          graduate a puppy from the litter to a new family, we make it our
          MISSION to always be a single-solution resource to inform, guide, and
          teach each new member of our ever-growing family.""
