<span> "Our goal as a professional breeder is simple, to deliver American Dobermans with the highest standard of quality to new 
owners. In order to make such a commitment in raising pups for new homes, we made a promise. The promise made is to ensure that 
with love and compassion, these pups will be properly raised. The responsibility of brining fragile lives into the world is a 
lifelong commitment from the Odremans. As we graduate a puppy from the litter to new families, we make it our MISSION to always 
be a single solution resource to inform, guide, and teach new members of our family!"</span>
